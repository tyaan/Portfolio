    title: "Analysis of Director Genders in Popular Films", 
    overview: "An R Shiny App visualising data on popular film directors", 
    details: <>
      I created this app to help me learn to develop data visualisation apps with the R Shiny library, and to learn about web scraping data.  
      <br />
      I started by scraping information on films from the Letterboxd website using the Selenium library with Python. 
      <br />
      I then cleaned the data using Python, transferred the data to R and created a range of data visualisations using the Shiny library.
